# Set the `embassy_time` tick rate.
#
# At most 1 `tick-*` feature can be enabled. If none is enabled, a default of 1MHz is used.
# 
# If the time driver in use supports using arbitrary tick rates, you can enable one `tick-*`
# feature from your binary crate to set the tick rate. The driver will use configured tick rate.
# If the time driver supports a fixed tick rate, it will enable one feature itself, so you should
# not enable one. Check the time driver documentation for details.
#
# When using embassy-time from libraries, you should *not* enable any `tick-*` feature, to allow the
# end user or the driver to pick.

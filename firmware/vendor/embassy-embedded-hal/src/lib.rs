/// and I2C. It allows changing the configuration at runtime.
///

/// drivers support different options. Therefore it is defined as an associated type.
///
/// For example, it is used by [`SpiDeviceWithConfig`](crate::shared_bus::asynch::spi::SpiDeviceWithConfig) and
///  [`I2cDeviceWithConfig`](crate::shared_bus::asynch::i2c::I2cDeviceWithConfig) to allow different
/// devices on the same bus to use different communication settings.

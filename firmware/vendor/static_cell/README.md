Statically allocated, initialized at runtime cell.

`StaticCell` provides a no-std-compatible, no-alloc way to reserve memory at compile time for
a value, but initialize it at runtime, and get a `'static` reference to it.

This is useful in the following scenarios:

- You need `&'static T`, but `T` can't be constructed in const context so you can't simply use a `static`.
- You need `&'static mut T`, not just `&'static T`.

## Example

```rust
use static_cell::StaticCell;

// Statically allocate memory for a `u32`.
static SOME_INT: StaticCell<u32> = StaticCell::new();

// Initialize it at runtime. This returns a `&'static mut`.
let x: &'static mut u32 = SOME_INT.init(42);
assert_eq!(*x, 42);

// Trying to call `.init()` again would panic, because the StaticCell is already initialized.
// SOME_INT.init(42);
```

## Alternatives

- If you can use `alloc`, you can use `Box::leak()`.
- If you're OK with `unsafe`, you can use `static mut THING: MaybeUninit<T>`.

## Interoperability

This crate uses [`atomic-polyfill`](https://github.com/embassy-rs/atomic-polyfill), so on targets without native
atomics you must import a crate that provides a [`critical-section`](https://github.com/rust-embedded/critical-section) 
implementation. See the `critical-section` README for details.
